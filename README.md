## Personal Workflow

* **Focus Hours** ⏳: I try to allocate 3-4 hours of my workday as "focus hours". I work in 25-50 minute long focus sessions, during which I try to avoid interruptions by closing my GMail browser tab, pausing my Slack notifications, and putting on noise-cancelling headphones. I sometimes use these focus hours for pair programming, but I try to minimize meetings during this time otherwise. This working style allows me to do [deep work](https://todoist.com/inspiration/deep-work).
* **Office Hours** 💬: I think of the rest of the workday as "office hours". I attend meetings, respond to Slack messages, and have conversations with co-workers. In other words, I use this time for collaboration.
* **Calendar Blocks** 🗓️: I generally put my focus hours into my calendar as time blocks so coworkers know when I'm free for meetings, messages, or conversations.
* **Slack Status** 🎧: Similarly, I signal to coworkers that I'm in a focus session by updating my Slack status (and including an end time for the focus session). 
* **Slack Inbox** 📨: After a focus session is over, I check my Slack messages for anything I might have missed. I check my Slack inbox more frequently than my email inbox. (I batch process email once per day.)
* **Urgent Issues** 🚨: If something urgent comes up that needs an immediate response, feel free to message me on Slack and choose the "notify anyway" option when it mentions that I have my notifications paused (or, if I'm in the office, just tap me on the shoulder).
