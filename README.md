## Personal Workflow

* **Focus Sessions** ⏳: I work in 25-50 minute long focus sessions, during which I try to avoid interruptions by closing my GMail browser tab, pausing my Slack notifications, and putting on noise-cancelling headphones.
* **Calendar Blocks** 🗓️: I generally put my focus sessions into my calendar as time blocks so coworkers know when I'm free for meetings or impromptu conversations.
* **Slack Status** 🎧: I signal to coworkers that I'm in a focus session by updating my Slack status (and including an end time for the focus session). 
* **Deep Work** 🧠: This working style allows me to minimize context-switching cognitive penalties and do deep work. 
* **Slack Inbox** 📨: After a focus session is over, I check my Slack messages for anything I might have missed. 
* **Urgent Issues** 🚨: If something urgent comes up that needs an immediate response, feel free to message me on Slack and choose the "notify anyway" option when it mentions that I have my notifications paused (or, if I'm in the office, just tap me on the shoulder).
