## Working Style

* **Focus Sessions**: I work in 25-50 minute long focus sessions, during which I try to avoid interruptions by closing my GMail browser tab, pausing my Slack notifications, and putting on noise-cancelling headphones ⏳
* **Slack Status**: I signal to coworkers that I'm in a focus session by updating my Slack status (and including an end time for the focus session) 🎧
* **Deep Work**: This working style allows me to minimize context-switching cognitive penalties and do deep work 🧠
* **Slack Inbox**: After a focus session is over, I check my Slack messages for anything I might have missed 📨
* **Urgent Issues**: If something urgent comes up that needs an immediate response, feel free to message me on Slack and choose the "notify anyway" option when it mentions that I have my notifications paused (or, if I'm in the office, just tap me on the shoulder) 🚨
